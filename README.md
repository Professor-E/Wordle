# Wordle
Duplicate of the game "Wordle" featured on the New York Times' website. I had programmed a replicate of Wordle, where the user must correctly guess a five letter word within five valid guesses. After guessing a valid word, the program will notify the user how close they are to guessing the secret word through cues displayed.
